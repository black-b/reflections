When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When I want to share  my work with others in my team. After some part of work is done (ex. new feature, fixed bugs etc.)

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Because I want to have better controll over version I am working on. I can check consistency or fix collisions (if exists with() new changes of somebody else.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Fork - is remote copy of somebody's else project, with no right to change the original one
    Clone - exact copy of project from my GitHub repository or local repository
    Branch - is just a local copy of master branch used to develop and testing of new changes - it is present in repository no matter where - "code path"

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
