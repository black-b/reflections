How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    With diff command it is easy find changes and mistakes (eg. typos). Diff shows exact lines of code, where change or mistake has been written.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    I can save my time. Don't have to search changes and bugs manually. Can see and prove performance in time. Have just one file in time.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Manually choosing makes version control much more clear. Automated saving can commit unrelated features. Tracking Across Multiple Files.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Files are related and adding one feature or change can affect more files, but the change is related to all of them (or none, but files are related anyway).

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log - list of recent commits, 
    git diff - show difeferencies between two versions

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    It is easy to test previous version and search for bugs. Differencies between versions shows possible sources of bugs. Therefore is easy to fix the bugs. Can make risk changes without being afraid of ruin my work. That allows explorations.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    I want to use it while I will be learning basics of web design and coding. Also It might be helpfull for versioning of text documents, notes, etc.
